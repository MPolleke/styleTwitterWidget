### Styling the Twitter Widget

Twitter Timeline Widget is a Twitter Widget written in JavaScript and provided by Twitter.com. You can use it freely in your website.

The widget adds an iframe to the page with a standard layout and styling. Adding Styling through a stylesheet has no effect on an iframe.

You can however add a stylesheet to an iframe, and thatâ€™s what this script does. All you have to do is change the location of the stylesheet in it. You can then add it to your page-layout. It does need jQuery available.

In case you are editing the stylesheet, but it doesn't refresh in the browser, you can open the stylesheet directly in the browser, and push F5 to have the cache of your browser refreshed.

The Timeline Widget with this script included is also available in a [WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/twitter-widget-with-styling/).

## Install steps:

1. Go to [Twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-timelines).
2. Create your own Embedded Timeline App.
3. Add the provided 'a' element to your page layout. It contains your name and ID.
4. Add this script to your page.
5. Enjoy!
